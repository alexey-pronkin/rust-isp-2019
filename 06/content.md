# `std`: Pointer Types

### CIS 198 Lecture 6

###### Reference: [TRPL 5.8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/choosing-your-guarantees.html)

## `&T` and `&mut T`

- Your basic, economy-class references.
- Zero runtime cost; all checks are done at compile time.
- Not allowed to outlive their associated lifetime.
    - Can introduce serious lifetime complexity if you're not careful!
- Use these unless you _actually_ need something more complicated.

---
## `Box<T>`

- A `Box<T>` is one of Rust's ways of allocating data on the heap.
- A `Box<T>` owns a `T`, so its pointer is unique - it can't be aliased (only referenced).
- `Box`es are automatically freed when they go out of scope.
- Almost the same as unboxed values, but dynamically allocated.
- Create a `Box` with `Box::new()`.

```rust
let boxed_five = Box::new(5);
```

---
## `Box<T>`

- Pros:
    - Easiest way to put something on the heap.
    - Zero-cost abstraction for dynamic allocation.
    - Shares typical borrowing and move semantics.
    - Automatic destruction.
- Cons (ish):
    - The `T` is strictly owned by the `Box` - only one owner.
        - This means the particular variable holding the box can't go away
          until all references are gone - sometimes this won't work out!

---
## Aside: Box Syntax & Patterns

- In homework 2 & 3, you may have noticed patterns like this:

```rust
let opt_box: Option<Box<i32>> = Some(Box::new(5));

match opt_box {
    Some(boxed) => {
        let unboxed = *boxed;
        println!("Some {}", unboxed);
    }
    None => println!("None :("),
}

```

---
## Aside: Box Syntax & Patterns

- It's currently not possible to destructure the `Box` inside the `Option`. :(
- In Nightly Rust, it is, thanks to `box` syntax!

```rust
#![feature(box_syntax, box_patterns)]

let opt_box = Some(box 5);

match opt_box {
    Some(box unboxed) => println!("Some {}", unboxed),
    None => println!("None :("),
}
```

- This may change before it reaches Stable.

---
## `std::rc::Rc<T>`

- Want to share a pointer with your friends? Use an `Rc<T>`!
- A "**R**eference **C**ounted" pointer.
    - Keeps track of how many aliases exist for the pointer.
- Call `clone()` on an `Rc` to get a reference.
    - Increments its reference count.
    - No data gets copied!
- When the ref count drops to 0, the value is freed.
- The `T` can only be mutated when the reference count is 1 ðŸ˜•.
    - Same as the borrowing rules - there must be only one owner.

```rust
let mut shared = Rc::new(6);
{
    println!("{:?}", Rc::get_mut(&mut shared)); // ==> Some(6)
}
let mut cloned = shared.clone(); // ==> Another reference to same data
{
    println!("{:?}", Rc::get_mut(&mut shared)); // ==> None
    println!("{:?}", Rc::get_mut(&mut cloned)); // ==> None
}
```

---
## `std::rc::Weak<T>`

- Reference counting has weaknesses: if a cycle is created:
    - A has an `Rc` to B, B has an `Rc` to A - both have count = 1.
    - They'll never be freed! ~~Eternal imprisonment~~ a memory leak!
- This can be avoided with _weak references_.
    - These don't increment the _strong reference_ count.
    - But that means they aren't always valid!
- An `Rc` can be downgraded into a `Weak` using `Rc::downgrade()`.
    - To access it, turn it back into `Rc`: `weak.upgrade() -> Option<Rc<T>>`
    - Nothing else can be done with `Weak` - upgrading prevents the value from becoming invalid mid-use.

---
## Strong Pointers vs. Weak Pointers

- When do you use an `Rc` vs. a `Weak`?
    - Generally, you probably want a strong reference via `Rc`.
- If your ownership semantics need to convey a notion of possible access to data but no
    ownership, you might want to use a `Weak`.
    - Such a structure would also need to be okay with the `Weak` coming up as
        `None` when upgraded.
- Any structure with reference cycles may also need `Weak`, to avoid the leak.
    - Note: `Rc` cycles are difficult to create in Rust, because of mutability rules.

---
## `std::rc::Rc<T>`

- Pros:
    - Allows sharing ownership of data.
- Cons:
    - Has a (small) runtime cost.
        - Holds two reference counts (strong and weak).
        - Must update and check reference counts dynamically.
    - Reference cycles can leak memory. This can only be resolved by:
        - Avoiding creating dangling cycles.
        - Garbage collection (which Rust doesn't have).

---
## Cells

- A way to wrap data to allow _interior mutability_.
- An _immutable_ reference allows modifying the contained value!
- There are two types of cell: `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>`.

```rust
struct Foo {
    x: Cell<i32>,
    y: RefCell<u32>,
}
```

---
## `std::cell::Cell<T>`

- A wrapper type providing interior mutability for `Copy` types.
    - `Cell<T>`s cannot contain references.
- Get values from a `Cell` with `get()`.
- Update the value inside a `Cell` with `set()`.
     - Can't mutate the `T`, only replace it.
- Generally pretty limited, but safe & cheap.

```rust
let c = Cell::new(10);
c.set(20);
println!("{}", c.get()); // 20
```

---
## `std::cell::Cell<T>`

- Pros:
    - Interior mutability.
    - No runtime cost!
    - Small allocation cost.
- Cons:
    - Very limited - only works on `Copy` types.

---
## `std::cell::RefCell<T>`

- A wrapper type providing interior mutability for any type.
- Uses dynamic borrow checking rules (performed at runtime).
    - This may cause a panic at runtime.
- Borrow inner data via `borrow()` or `borrow_mut()`.
    - These may panic if the `RefCell` is already borrowed!

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let refc = RefCell::new(vec![12]);
let mut inner = refc.borrow_mut();
inner.push(24);
println!("{:?}", *inner); // [12, 24]

let inner2 = refc.borrow();
// ==> Panics since refc is already borrow_mut'd!
```

---
## `std::cell::RefCell<T>`

- A common paradigm is putting a `RefCell` inside an `Rc` to allow shared mutability.
- Not thread-safe! `borrow()` et al don't prevent race conditions.
- There is no way (in stable Rust) to check if a borrow will panic before executing it.
    - `borrow_state(&self)` is an unstable way to do this.

---
## `std::cell::RefCell<T>`

- Pros:
    - Interior mutability for any type.
- Cons:
    - Stores an additional borrow state variable.
    - Must check borrow state to dynamically allow borrows.
    - May panic at runtime.
    - Not thread-safe.

---
## `std::cell::Ref<T>` & `RefMut<T>`

- When you invoke `borrow()` on a `RefCell<T>`, you actually get `Ref<T>`, not `&T`.
    - Similarly, `borrow_mut()` gives you a `RefMut<T>`.
- These are pretty simple wrapper over `&T`, but define some extra methods.
    - Sadly, all of them are unstable pending the `cell_extras` feature ðŸ˜ž.

---
## `*const T` & `*mut T`

- C-like raw pointers: they just point... somewhere in memory.
- No ownership rules.
- No lifetime rules.
- Zero-cost abstraction... because there is no abstraction.
- Requires `unsafe` to be dereferenced.
    - May eat your laundry if you're not careful.
- Use these if you're building a low-level structure like `Vec<T>`, but not in
  typical code.
    - Can be useful for manually avoiding runtime costs.
- We won't get to unsafe Rust for a while, but for now:
    - Unsafe Rust is basically C with Rust syntax.
    - Unsafe means having to manually maintain Rust's assumptions
      (borrowing, non-nullability, non-undefined memory, etc.)
